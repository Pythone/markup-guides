# markup-guides
This repository is to preserve and to learn different markup language (alive,dead,otherwise)
## What this mission is about:
some markdown languages are going to be extinct due to not being used any more.
Some are gone due to the site(s) the syntax is hosted on not being available.
We also want to modernize and bring back WML!
